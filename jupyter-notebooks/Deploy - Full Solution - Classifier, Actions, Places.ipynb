ICLR is an independent, not for profit research institute founded by the insurance industry and affiliated with the University of Western Ontario. The Institute s mission is to reduce the loss of life and property caused by severe weather and earthquakes through the identification and support of sustained actions that improve society s capacity to adapt to, anticipate, mitigate, withstand and recover from natural disasters. ICLR s mandate is to confront the alarming increase in disaster losses caused by natural disasters and to work to reduce disaster deaths, injuries and property damage. Disaster damage has been doubling every five to seven years since the 1960s, an alarming trend. The greatest tragedy is that many disaster losses are preventable. ICLR is committed to the development and communication of disaster prevention knowledge. This document identifies the steps you can take to better protect your home from wildfires.

       " 'Fire is a natural process essential to maintain healthy forests. Wildland fires can also be a terrifying peril that threatens lives and property. Wildfires burn on average 20,000 km2 of forest each year in Canada. When these fires approach our communities they can force families to evacuate. In fighting these fires, firefighters are sometimes called upon to make decisions on which properties can be defended and which cannot. Over the last several centuries, large parts of Canada have burned repeatedly. 50 per cent of Canada s wildfires are caused by people. Most of the other half is caused by lightning strikes on dry forest. This is why the risk of wildfires is highest in the summer. Photo: Shutterstock If you live in or near a forested area, you re living in an area often referred to as the wildland urban interface and sooner or later you may have to contend with a wildfire. The risk of wildfires is increasing in many parts of Canada and your best protection against loss, damage or injury is prevention. ICLR has partnered with the Government of Alberta to distribute the FireSmart Home Owners Manual. This material details the specific actions that Canadians should take in order to protect their homes from wildfires. 1',\n",
       " 'Properly preparing your home and community doesn t completely guarantee you won t incur fire damage, but it does reduce the risk. Make sure you have adequate insurance on your home and property. Some of the measures in this manual cost very little and help reduce your vulnerability to wildfire others require planning and a long term commitment. Let s look at three areas where you can apply FireSmart principles to protect or reduce the damage to your property from a wildfire. 1. Site preparation Any kind of vegetation is Priority zone 3 combustible. Mature trees, shrubs, grass and even your Priority zone 2 woodpile can easily ignite and increase the Priority zone 1 chance of wildfire damaging your home and property. Managing the space around your 10 m home and buildings is of utmost importance. 20 m 70 m Do you have a cleared zone around your house and buildings? The 10 metre space immediately surrounding Priority zones surronding an interface your home is Priority Zone 1. It s the most building or group of buildings. critical area to introduce FireSmart principles. A fuel free space will give firefighters a chance to save your home from an advancing wildfire. A home without a fuel free space can make firefighting difficult, if not impossible. What to do? Remove flammable trees and shrubs, such as pine, spruce and juniper. Other species such as aspen, poplar and birch have lower flammability rates. Also remove deadfall or woodpiles from this area. Keep your grass mowed and watered. 2',\n",
       " 'How FireSmart is your Second Priority zone? The area extending from 10 to 30 metres away from your home is Priority Zone 2. In this zone, you need to reduce fuels by thinning and pruning trees so that intense wildfires don t have as much fuel to burn. What to do? Remove any trees and debris that would support the rapid spread of a wildfire. Make sure to thin or space trees so that the crowns tops of individual trees are at least 3 to 6 metres apart. Remove tree branches up to 2 metres from the ground. Also remove thick shrubbery and deadfall to reduce the chance that a wildfire will climb up into the forest canopy. Once a wildfire is crowning, it s very difficult to stop. Because fires spread more easily uphill and downwind it s important to extend Priority Zone 2 further on downhill slopes and on windward exposures. Can you extend your FireSmart maintenance plan to the Third Priority zone? Priority Zone 3 begins 30 metres from your home and extends to a distance of 100 metres and beyond. In this zone the objective is not to remove all combustible fuels from the forest, but to thin the area so fires will be low intensity and more easily Low stand density where Tree crowns do not touch extinguished. trees are widely spaced. or overlap. What to do? Thin or reduce the shrubs and trees that make up the understory. Try to keep fire resistant trees such as aspen, poplar and birch, while spacing more flammable trees so that each individual crown is at least 3 to 6 metres apart. 3',\n",

Building construction The second set of FireSmart guidelines deals with building materials and design standards. While it may not be practical or economical to apply all of them to an existing structure, many FireSmart modifications are easily accomplished.
